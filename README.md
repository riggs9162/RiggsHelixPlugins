# Riggs Helix Plugins
This is a collection of plugins I've made for the Helix Framework. I'll be adding more as I make them. I'll also be adding more documentation as I go. If you have any questions feel free to ask me on discord.

## Installation
To install these plugins you need to press the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Once you've downloaded the zip file you need to open it, select the plugins you want to use and drag them into your Schema's "Plugins" folder. And that's it, you're done. You can now start your server and the plugins will be loaded. If you want to configure the plugins you can do so by editing the file itself or the sh_plugin.lua file in the respective plugin folder.
